# House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices using advanced machine learning models trained on the California Housing dataset. The performance of **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and a **Neural Network** is compared, with a focus on **R² scores** and **prediction accuracy**.

## Key Features
- **Random Forest**: Hyperparameter-tuned with GridSearchCV for precise, ensemble-based predictions.
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with optimized parameters for high-performance regression.
- **Neural Network**: Fully connected deep learning model leveraging TensorFlow/Keras for complex, non-linear relationships.
- **Evaluation**: Visual and numerical comparisons using R² scores and scatter plots of actual vs. predicted prices.

## Highlights
- Achieved **R² > 0.84** across all models, demonstrating strong predictive performance.
- Provides insights into the strengths and trade-offs of ensemble methods vs. deep learning.
- Modular and extensible architecture enables easy integration of new algorithms or datasets.
